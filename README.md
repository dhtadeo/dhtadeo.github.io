# TadeoWeb (v1.1.2)

This is a very minor update.
- Changed Nexai Dynasty table data as major changes happened in the time passed.
- The Nexai Dynasty table is still not responsive but I added a fancy warning for mobile users. ðŸ˜ƒ
- Changed BG font from a winter themed one.
- Deleted some useless files just stored for nothing.

### Sneak Peeks
- I'm working in some sort of canvas where you can draw anything you want, export and import your art n' stuff, but I want to add this into a small database where the drawings that people made may be shown here. It's database area, still not my forte but probably I might add the canvas just with export and import functionalities in late-November or December.
- If I decide to go rough and add the database system, this might require the website to be updated to an app instead of pure HTML and files and might take longer than expected. (I'm still thinking about this).
